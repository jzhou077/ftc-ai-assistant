## FTC AI Assistant

FTC AI Assistant is designed to be a free and easy-to-use resource for teams participating in FTC. Unlike ChatGPT, it has context about this season's FTC game, Into the Deep, allowing it to be able to accurately answer any questions that can be found in the game manual. I created this in part because in these past few years of participating in FTC, I have found it quite troublesome to find specific details about the season's challenge (e.g. size of scoring element, height of field elements, number of points for a specific task, etc.). Even with ctrl+f, it can be very difficult to find exactly what you need in such a large file. FTC Assistant helps greatly reduce the time spent doing that. In the future, I will update the chatbot to also have specific context and directions for teaching how to program an FTC bot as well as any other suggestions users might have.
